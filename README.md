Phalcon Incubator
=================

Phalcon PHP is a web framework delivered as a C extension providing high
performance and lower resource consumption.

This is a repository to publish/share/experimient with new adapters, prototypes
or functionality that potentially can be incorporated to the C-framework.

Also we welcome submissions from the community of snippets that could
extend the framework more.

The code in this repository is written in PHP.
